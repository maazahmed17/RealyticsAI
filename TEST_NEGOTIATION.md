# Testing the Negotiation Feature

## Quick Start
Make sure your backend server is running on `http://localhost:8000`

## Test Method 1: Via Recommendation Button

### Steps:
1. **Open the app** in browser
2. **Ask for recommendations**: 
   ```
   "Show me 1 BHK properties in Basaveshwara Nagar"
   ```
3. **Wait for response** with property recommendations in sidebar
4. **Look for negotiation bar** at bottom (should appear automatically)
   - Should show property details with price
5. **Click "Start Negotiation"** button
6. **Prompt will appear** showing:
   ```
   Property asking price is ‚Çπ39.9 Lakhs.
   
   What is your target price in Lakhs?
   ```
7. **Enter your target** (e.g., `35`)
8. **Get analysis** in chat

### Expected Result:
Clean negotiation analysis like:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Gap - Negotiable

Your target of 35.0 Lakhs is 12.3% below the asking price of 39.9 Lakhs.

While there's a gap, this is within negotiable range in current market 
conditions. Consider starting slightly higher (around 36.5 Lakhs) to 
leave room for negotiation.

Next Steps:
- Start with a counter around 36.5 Lakhs
- Highlight any property issues or market comparables
- Be prepared to meet somewhere in the middle
```

## Test Method 2: Via Chat (One-Shot)

```

**Expected**: Analysis of 85 vs 95 (10.5% gap)

## Debug Tips

### Check Browser Console:
Look for:
```
Negotiation context set: { propertyId, askingPrice, ... }
```

### Check Backend Logs:
Look for:
```
Negotiation API call failed: ...
Negotiation handling error: ...
```

### Verify Price Extraction:
In browser console after recommendations:
```javascript
console.log(currentNegotiationContext);
// Should show: { propertyId: "...", askingPrice: 39.9, ... }
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Property price information is not available"
**Fix**: Check that recommendations have `price`, `estimated_price`, or `list_price` field

### Issue: No negotiation bar appears
**Fix**: Check browser console for `currentNegotiationContext` object

### Issue: Chat shows generic tips
**Fix**: Ensure message contains both asking and target prices, or follow conversational flow

### Issue: Analysis seems wrong
**Fix**: Check that prices are being extracted as floats, not strings
