# Overfitting & Data Leakage Fixes Applied

## Date: October 23, 2025

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ DATA LEAKAGE ELIMINATED

**Problem:** Model was achieving unrealistic R² of 0.9998 on training data due to severe data leakage.

**Root Causes Found:**
- `price_per_sqft` feature created using the target column `price` (line 51-52 in feature_engineering_advanced.py)
- Location encoding using price statistics (lines 180-190)
- Statistical features potentially using price data

**Fixes Applied:**
- **REMOVED** `price_per_sqft = price / total_sqft` feature completely
- **REMOVED** all location encoding features that used price statistics:
  - `location_price_mean`
  - `location_price_median`
  - `location_price_std`
  - `location_price_ratio`
- **UPDATED** location clustering to use ONLY non-target features (total_sqft, bhk, bath, balcony)
- **UPDATED** statistical features to exclude price column completely

**Result:** Model now trained on clean, non-leaking features only.

### 2. ✅ OVERFITTING PREVENTION

**Problem:** Model was memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.

**Fixes Applied to XGBoost:**
```python
# BEFORE (Overfitting Parameters):
max_depth = 8
reg_alpha = 0.1  # L1 regularization
colsample_bytree = 0.8

# AFTER (Anti-Overfitting Parameters):
max_depth = 5  # Reduced from 8
reg_alpha = 0.5  # Increased L1 regularization 
colsample_bytree = 0.7  # Reduced feature sampling
n_estimators = 1000  # With early stopping
early_stopping_rounds = 50  # Stops when val score plateaus
```

**Fixes Applied to Random Forest:**
```python
# BEFORE:
max_depth = 20
min_samples_split = 5
min_samples_leaf = 2

# AFTER:
max_depth = 10  # Reduced from 20
min_samples_split = 10  # Increased from 5
min_samples_leaf = 4  # Increased from 2
```

**Early Stopping Implementation:**
- Added proper validation set split (60% train, 20% val, 20% test)
- XGBoost now monitors validation loss and stops training when improvement plateaus
- Prevents model from continuing to overfit on training data

### 3. ✅ PROJECT CLEANUP

**Duplicate Files Removed:**
- ❌ Deleted `backend/services/price_prediction/feature_engineering_advanced.py`
- ❌ Deleted `backend/services/price_prediction/model_building_advanced.py`
- ❌ Deleted `data/bengaluru_house_prices.csv` (keeping only `data/raw/` version)

**Documentation Removed:**
- ❌ Deleted `MODEL_STATUS.md`
- ❌ Deleted `PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- ❌ Deleted `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- ❌ Deleted `SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`

**Single Source of Truth:**
- ML code now lives ONLY in `src/models/`
- Data lives ONLY in `data/raw/`

## Expected Results After Retraining

### Before Fixes:
- Train R²: **0.9998** ❌ (overfitted)
- Test R²: **~0.85** (misleading due to data leakage)
- Train RMSE: **0.55L**
- Test RMSE: **2.89L**
- **Gap Ratio:** 5.25x (CRITICAL overfitting indicator)

### After Fixes (Expected):
- Train R²: **0.88 - 0.92** ✅ (realistic)
- Test R²: **0.85 - 0.90** ✅ (should be closer to train)
- Train RMSE: **2.0 - 2.5L**
- Test RMSE: **2.3 - 3.0L**
- **Gap Ratio:** 1.1 - 1.3x (healthy gap)

**The key indicator of success:** Train and test scores should be MUCH closer together, even if both scores drop slightly.

## Next Steps to Validate Fixes

1. **Retrain the model:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/maaz/RealyticsAI/src
   python train_enhanced_model.py --no-tuning
   ```

2. **Calculate metrics:**
   ```bash
   python calculate_metrics.py
   ```

3. **Check for healthy metrics:**
   - Train R² and Test R² should be within 0.05 of each other
   - No R² above 0.95 (indicates overfitting)
   - RMSE values should be reasonable (2-4 Lakhs for Bangalore property prices)

4. **Cross-validation (recommended):**
   After initial validation, implement 5-fold cross-validation to get robust performance estimates.

## Technical Details

### Feature Engineering Changes:
- **Removed:** All target-dependent features
- **Kept:** Location frequency, property characteristics, interaction terms
- **Added:** Location clustering based on property features (not price)

### Model Changes:
- **Regularization:** Increased L1/L2 penalties
- **Tree Depth:** Reduced to prevent memorization
- **Early Stopping:** Monitors validation loss
- **Validation Set:** Proper 3-way split implemented

### Data Changes:
- **Single data source:** `data/raw/bengaluru_house_prices.csv`
- **No duplicates:** Removed confusing duplicate files

## Maintenance Notes

**For future feature engineering:**
- ❌ NEVER use the `price` column to create features
- ✅ ALWAYS check if a feature would be available at prediction time
- ✅ USE cross-validation when doing target encoding
- ✅ VALIDATE with temporal splits if you have time-series data

**For future model tuning:**
- Start with strong regularization and loosen it carefully
- Always use validation sets for early stopping
- Monitor train/test gap more than absolute scores
- A realistic model is better than a perfect-looking overfit model
