- **Training Data:** 150,000 Bengaluru properties
- **Location Stats:** Computed from full dataset at prediction time

### Property Database

✅ Increase with larger size (2000 sqft > 1500 sqft)  
✅ Be within reasonable Bengaluru market range (₹30L - ₹150L typical)

### Property Recommendations Should:

## Troubleshooting

### If predictions are still stuck at ₹1.85 Crores:
1. Check if model files exist:
   ```bash
   ls -lh /home/maaz/RealyticsAI/data/models/xgboost_fixed_*.pkl
   ```
2. Verify data file is accessible:
   ```bash
   ls -lh /home/maaz/RealyticsAI/data/bengaluru_house_prices.csv
   ```
3. Restart the chatbot (exit and run again)

### If recommendations show "Unknown":
1. Clear Python cache:
   ```bash
   find /home/maaz/RealyticsAI -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
   ```
2. Restart the chatbot

### If you see warnings about feature mismatch:
- This is expected on first run as the system initializes
- Should disappear after first successful prediction
- If it persists, check that all 25 features are being generated
